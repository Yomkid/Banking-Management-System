# Banking-Management-System
The Bank Management System (BMS) is a web-based application used for paying financial institutions for the services they provide to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. BMS also provides analytical tools to review, and approve compensation, budgets, and outflows.
This mini project was carried out during HND 1 first semester by Odewaye Mayomi Peter.
And this project will be modified from time to time.
